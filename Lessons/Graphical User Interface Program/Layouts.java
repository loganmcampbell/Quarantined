    /*
        JAVA uses layout managers to have different Graphic User Interfaces.
        The four most used layout managers are BorderLayout/BoxLayout/FlowLayout/GridLayout.

        [BorderLayout]: divides its window into 5 parts that have fixed positions relative to each other. Each part can hold a component, and the size of the part controls the component's size.
            - BorderLayout region can only contain one component.
            - If one is left out empty then it will not show up in the window.
            - Even thought each region on holds one component; We can make a panel hold other components and use different layouts

        [BoxLayout]: allows each component to keep its own size. Stacks components in the order we add them and we can choose to stack them vertically or horizontally.
            - Components are the size of what is contained.
            -
